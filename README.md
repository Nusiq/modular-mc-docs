# ModularMC

This repository contains the documentation for the ModularMC Regolith filter. ModularMC is a TypeScript-based successor to the System Template filter, designed to organize Minecraft addon files into logical modules based on their purpose rather than their file type.

You can read the documentation [here](https://modular-mc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

If you're looking for the filter itself, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Nusiq/regolith-filters/tree/master/modular_mc).

## Key Features

- **Module organization**: Group files by purpose, making projects easier to understand and maintain
- **JSON templating**: Dynamic content generation using TypeScript expressions inside JSON files
- **Script compilation**: Built-in Esbuild support for TypeScript/JavaScript compilation
- **Familiar syntax**: Uses familiar for most addon developers TypeScript syntax for configuration and templating
- **Easy sharing**: Modules can be copied between projects or shared with other developers
